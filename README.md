A **Machine Learning + Streamlit** project that predicts the species of an **Iris flower** (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four flower measurements:  

- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

This project demonstrates how to:  
✅ Train an **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** model on the Iris dataset  
✅ Save the trained model using **Pickle**  
✅ Create a **Streamlit web app** frontend for real-time predictions

## 📖 Introduction  

The **Iris dataset** is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning, often used as a beginner project for classification tasks.  

In this project:  
- We trained a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier on the dataset.  
- The trained model was saved as `iris_svm_model.pkl`.  
- A **Streamlit app** was built to provide an interactive UI where users can enter flower measurements and get instant predictions.  

This combines **ML model training** with **frontend deployment**.

## 📊 Example Prediction  

**Input values:**  
- Sepal Length = 5.5  
- Sepal Width = 3.0  
- Petal Length = 4.2  
- Petal Width = 1.3  

**Predicted Output:** 🌼 *Versicolor*

## 🎯 Conclusion  

This project shows how a **classic ML dataset (Iris)** can be used to build:  
- A **classification model (SVM)**  
- A **frontend app (Streamlit)**  
- An **end-to-end ML pipeline** (training → saving → deployment)  

🔮 Future Improvements:  
- Add more ML models (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression)  
- Enhance UI with flower images  
- Deploy to **Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / Render**
